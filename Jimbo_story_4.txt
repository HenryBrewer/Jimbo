CHAPTER FOUR
					Diamonds


It had been 4 hours since the escape. I still hear the gasp as the man with Jet black hair, who Dylan called Micheal, had made when he had been struck by an arrow through the head, “Sir, what should we do?” Dylan asked.
“I DON” T KNOW! WERE STUCK IN A CAVE WITH MOSS WHEN I WAS A KING! WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO!” I yell at Dylan, I know I am being unfair, it’s not his fault this has happened, but I need someone to let my anger out at,
“Um, sir? May I ask why you wanted me?” Alexander whispers. And then all of a sudden I hear a noise.
“HeNRyy?” A wretched voice calls.
“King get down! IT MIGHT BE A HUMAN!” Dylan exclaims
“No, that’s a Jimbo, I can tell by the voice,” I say
“DO YoU KnOw WHO I Am?” The wretched voice calls.
“Uh, no?” I yell back
“SHOW YOURSELF!” Dylan orders
“DOes This HeLp?” He says as he comes out with diamonds coming out of his eyes mixed with his tears. A dark gray cloak covering him
“Wha-wa-WHAT!, bu-bu-but, only royal blood can do that, who are you?” I stammer
“Hello little brother,” he says with a creepy smile
“SIR, I CALL ORDER! THIS MAN CAN’T COME IN HERE AND SAY HE’S FIRST BORN!” Dylan shouts
“I AGREE” Alexander says
“ONLY %100, royal blood can challenge when there’s already a king!” Dylan yells
“What if I was always the rightful heir?” He questions as he randomly flexes his neck.
“Everybody be quiet! Do you hear that?” Dylan says
“What? What do you hear?” The mysterious voice says
Then I hear it quite voices, closing in, 
“I hear it!” I whisper
“I still don't hear it! Wait, now I hear it, a little squeak!” The unidentified voice says, being careful to be quiet, “Gatcha! I caught a rat! Wait! What's that marching noise! I hear something! Do you guys hear it!”
“Do you have a way out?” Dylan asks him
“YeS, well I do know of a secret tunnel but…” He pauses, “I don't exactly know where it goes.”
“You don’t know if there's a way out, in your own cave or whatever this is, but you know there's a tunnel” I question him
“I don’t know, I certainly don’t have any power in this situation, but I think it’s are best option, because if we don’t go were all sitting ducks” Alexander stated being careful not to insult me
“You don’t have to be so formal Alexander.” I told him.
“Thank you sir,” he said with a smile on his face.
“I agree with Alexander,” Dylan states.
“Then I guess we should go,” I say.
“Ok foll-” Jeffrey starts.
“FIND THEM! THEY MUST BE DOWN HERE!” A human voice interrupts.
