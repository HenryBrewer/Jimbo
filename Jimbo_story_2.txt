CHAPTER TWO
Loss

“Wh-what? Oh, ok, but who can we ask? WE HAVE NOTHING; NO FIGHTERS ARE LEFT!” I demanded,
“I might know someone…” Dylan quietly said
“Fine… Who?” I asked
“Alexander.”
“THE MAN WHO WAS OUTLAWED AND PLACED AS A SERVANT FOR MICHEAL NAUGHTON !” I EXCLAIMED
“Um… That’s the one,” said Dylan
“Fine! But only since we’re desperate”
“Follow me,” Dylan said
“Ok”
