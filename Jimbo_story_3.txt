CHAPTER THREE
Outlaw

We saw a two-story simple house, nestled in the hills, as we got closer we heard “FETCH THE WOOD” “NO!” “DO BETTER” “GOOD NOW MAKE A MEAL FOR ME, YOU CAN HAVE THE LEFTOVERS”
“Seems, er… unfair punishment?????” I told Dylan
“OH NO! He poisoned the queen so she couldn’t go to the ball with the king because he wanted the queen for himself!” Dylan informed me
“OH! WAIT WHY ARE WE ASKING FOR STUFF!” I exclaimed
“Because he’s a wizard…” Dylan said
“WHAT WHY IS HE HERE!”
“We put a binding spell that only royal blood can unbind.”
“Oh ok”
“So… You need to unbind it,” Dylan said
“YOU WANT ME TO UNBIND A SPELL, ON THE PERSON WHO STALKED MY MOM?”I exclaimed
“Er… Yeah?”
“Fine,” I said as I almost trip over wooden steps leading to their doorway
“Were here” Dylan said
“Couldn’t see that” I murmured
Knock knock
“Yes?” a man with rags says, and then gasp and needs
“You may rise”
“MASTER MICHAEL THE PRINCE ER KING IS HERE!”
“WHAT!” a man with jet black hair says while he comes down the stairs
“OH SIR!” he, says and kneels
“Rise,” I command 
“What do we o the pleasure O great Jimbo prince”
“I come bearing horrible news, the humans have attacked, and every Jimbo but us has been captured or slaughtered”
“Even the king?” I believe it’s Alexander I almost tripped wearing rags
“DON’T SPEAK TO THE KING LIKE THAT! YOU SERVE ME!” The man with the jet-black hair bellows
“I place Alexander Miranda under my command!”I inform him
“What you can’t do-” The man with jet-black hair starts.
Swoosh, an arrow pierces his head he makes a small gasp, then his eyes go cold and he falls back lifeless, blood spooling around the arrow  wound
“SIR! RUN! TAKE COVER!” Dylan yells as he pushes the wizard out of the way just as an arrow aimed for him wedges in the wood where the wizard was
“AHHH!” The wizard screams, even though he’s not injured
“Do you know any -” I start
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh
“Escape routes?” I finish
Whoosh, Whoosh, whoosh
“Yes,” Alexander says
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, arrows flew, “DOWN THE HALL SIR! ALEXANDER GO IN FRONT OF ME” Dylan yells
Alexander ran in front of me, and kicked at a wooden board, it fell with a woosh, I hadn’t even begun to think that would be a secret passage, I slid through it, after Alexander, while Dylan shut the door, all of the light escaped, now only little slits of lights peer in through the cracks, “FIND HIM!” Dylan nudges me from behind to keep moving.
